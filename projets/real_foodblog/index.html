			<h3>What are fritters ?</h3>
			<p>Fritters are pieces of fruit, vegetable, or meat that are coated in batter and deep-fried.</p>

<p>Today, we’re making fritters! Healthy ones ! How so, you ask? Well, let me first set the context. 
<strike>I like</strike> <em>I love </em> fritters. All kinds of fritters. However, as I’ve been  trying to eat healthier lately, I tend to avoid those. Nonetheless, they are still my go-to for parties with friends and family meetings. Simple and tasty, what else would you want ? 
When a friend of mine told me about this recipe, I immediately looked forward to make it. Combining healthy food and the texture I like sounded like so much fun ! 
I tried it out yesterday, here’s a picture :

		<p>My thoughts : I’m a bit disappointed . Obviously, I was « hyped » as youngsters say, but still would’ve expected a bit more. Maybe it’s just me who can’t cook properly.  It’s still really savoury and makes for a good appetizer overall, but lacks the consistency of the original.</p>
		<br>
		<p>My friends loved it though, so I encourage you to try it out for yourself and share your experience in the comments down below :)</p>
